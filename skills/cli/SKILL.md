# Deepgram CLI (`deepctl`)

One PyPI package, `deepctl`, installs three interchangeable binaries: `dg`, `deepctl`, and `deepgram`. All three report the same version and take the same arguments. This skill uses `dg`. The current release is 0.3.1, published 2026-09-29.

## Decision rule

Reach for the CLI when the work is a shell task: transcribe a file or URL, synthesize a WAV, list keys or usage, scaffold a starter, or wire a step into CI.

Reach for curl or the `api` skill when you need a parameter the CLI does not expose. The docs state the rule plainly: `dg listen` "does not forward arbitrary API parameters." There is no `--keyterm`, no `--channels` for multichannel splitting, and no `--callback` or async callback mode.

`dg api` is the escape hatch: it passes any endpoint and query string through with auth attached, so `dg api '/v1/listen?model=nova-3&keyterm=spacewalk' -X POST --input body.json` reaches a parameter the flags omit. Bodies are text only, never binary: `--input` sends the file as JSON when it parses and verbatim when it does not, so a plain-text body works, but `--input audio.wav` fails with `Error building request body: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte`, and a local-file request that needs an unsupported parameter still belongs in curl. Its stdout is two JSON documents rather than one; the `dg api` paragraph under Command reference has the contract to read before piping it.

Reach for an SDK when Deepgram is part of an application rather than a shell step, meaning anything with a WebSocket lifecycle, retries, or a UI. The CLI streams, but it owns the connection.

## Install

```bash
brew install deepgram/tap/deepgram               # also installs ffmpeg + portaudio
curl -fsSL https://deepgram.com/install.sh | sh  # macOS / Linux
pip install deepctl                              # or: uv tool install deepctl / pipx install deepctl
uvx deepctl --help                               # run without installing (also: pipx run deepctl)
```

On Windows: `iwr https://deepgram.com/install.ps1 -useb | iex`.

Upgrade the way you installed: `brew upgrade deepgram`, re-run `install.sh`, `pip install --upgrade deepctl`, `uv tool upgrade deepctl`, or `pipx upgrade deepctl`. `dg update --check-only` is the version check, printing `current_version`, `latest_version`, and `update_available`. Bare `dg update` reports `"installation_method": null` on a pip install, so treat it as a reporter and upgrade through your installer.

The fully qualified formula name is what Homebrew 6 needs: a third-party formula loads only after it is trusted, and `brew install deepgram/tap/deepgram` trusts that one formula. The two-step `brew tap deepgram/tap && brew install deepgram` fails until a separate `brew trust` step.

Homebrew lags PyPI. pip, uv, and pipx install 0.3.1, but `Formula/deepgram.rb` in the tap pins `deepctl-0.2.26`. That release already routes `flux-*` models to `/v2/listen` and `/v2/speak`, so Flux STT and Flux TTS work from the Homebrew install. What it lacks is what 0.3.0 changed: the `dg speak` default moved from Aura-2 to `flux-alexis-en`, `dg speak` gained `--speed` and `--expressivity`, `dg listen` gained `--redact` and `--numerals`, and the exit-code contract (0 success, 1 error, 2 interrupt) replaced exiting 0 on every outcome. Install from PyPI if you script against any of those.

`dg listen --mic` needs an extra on the PyPI installs: `pip install 'deepctl-cmd-listen[mic]'`. The Homebrew install brings the audio dependencies itself.

## Authentication

Three paths, in order of preference:

- `export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...`, plus `DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID=...` for the account commands. This is the CI path.
- `dg login` for the browser flow, or `dg login --api-key "$KEY" --project-id "$PROJECT" -f`. Credentials go to the OS keyring when one exists. When it does not, as in Linux containers and CI, `dg` prints `Warning: Could not store in keyring: No recommended backend was available` and the key lands in `config.yaml` instead.
- The global `--api-key` flag overrides both. The CLI's own help calls it "intended for testing and CI"; it puts the key in shell history and in the process list, so prefer the env var.

The config file is `config.yaml` in the platform config directory: `~/Library/Application Support/deepctl/` on macOS and `~/.config/deepctl/` on Linux. It is written in cleartext at mode 0644.

The env-var path is not guaranteed to stay off disk. Any command that persists configuration copies the key it read from the environment into that cleartext file. On 0.3.1 with the env var set and no config file, `dg whoami`, `dg listen`, `dg projects --list`, and `dg models` write nothing, but `dg update --check-only` creates it with `api_key:` in it, and `dg projects --set-default` does the same. Treat the file as a secret, and give CI an ephemeral `HOME`.

`dg whoami` shows status; add `-o json` for `authenticated`, `project_id`, `base_url`, and `key_source`, which names where the key came from, for example `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY (env)`.

With no key, every API-backed command prints this, with your own config path in the parentheses:

```
Error: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY is not set in the configuration file
(.../deepctl/config.yaml) or environment variable.
```

`dg keys`, `dg usage`, `dg billing`, `dg members`, and `dg requests` also need a project, or they fail with `ERROR: Project ID is required for this command. Set DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID or configure via profile.` Fix that with `dg projects --set-default <project_id>` or the env var.

## Command surface

23 top-level commands in 0.3.1. `dg transcribe` also survives as a hidden, deprecated alias of `dg listen`.

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| Media | `listen` (STT), `speak` (TTS), `read` (text intelligence) |
| Account | `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `profiles`, `projects`, `keys`, `members`, `usage`, `billing`, `requests`, `models` |
| Raw API | `api` |
| Agent tooling | `mcp`, `skills`, `init` |
| Local | `debug` (`audio`, `browser`, `network`, `probe`, `toolkit`), `ffprobe`, `completion`, `plugin` (`install`, `list`, `remove`, `search`, `update`), `update` |

Account commands are flag-based, so the action is a flag rather than a subcommand: `dg projects --list`, not `dg projects list`.

Global flags go before the subcommand: `dg --base-url <url> listen file.wav`, never `dg listen --base-url <url>`. `--base-url`, `--api-key`, `-p`, `-c`, and `--timing` all fail with `No such option` after it. On 0.3.1, `-o`, `-q`, and `-v` are also accepted after the subcommand, so `dg listen file.wav -o json` and `dg -o json listen file.wav` are equivalent, with one exception: on `dg speak`, `-o` after the subcommand is the output file, so put the format flag before `speak`. `-o` takes `json`, `yaml`, `table`, or `csv`.

The CLI detects agent environments, including Claude Code, Aider, and OpenAI Codex, and switches to JSON with plain-text status lines; force that with `CI=true` or `--non-interactive`. Four soft signals also count, one point each: a non-TTY stdin, a non-TTY stdout, an unset or `dumb` `TERM`, and a set `NO_COLOR`. Three points switch to JSON, so a command with stdin and stdout both piped and no `TERM` already prints JSON, while a piped stdout alone does not. Pass `-o json` rather than relying on redirection.

Separately, every command except the `skills`, `debug`, and `plugin` groups accepts `--agent-friendly`, which prints a machine-readable spec of that command, covering its description, examples, every parameter, `requires_auth`, and `requires_project`, then exits without calling the API.

## Command reference

```bash
# Transcribe a URL or a file. Nova, defaulting to nova-3 and en-US.
dg listen https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav
dg -o table listen call.wav --diarize --smart-format     # [Speaker 0] prefixes
dg -o json listen call.wav | jq -r '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'

# Flux STT streams only, so feed it stdin or --mic
ffmpeg -i call.wav -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 - \
  | dg listen -m flux-general-en --encoding linear16 --sample-rate 16000

# Text-to-speech. The default model is flux-alexis-en: Flux TTS over WebSocket, WAV out.
dg speak "Deploy finished." -o notice.wav
dg speak "Deploy finished." -m aura-2-asteria-en -o notice.mp3   # Aura on Speak v1 REST, for MP3
dg speak --file script.txt --speed 0.9 -o slow.wav               # --speed and --expressivity are flux-* only

# Text intelligence
dg -o table read --sentiment --topics --summarize --file feedback.txt

# Account
dg projects --list
dg projects --set-default <project_id>
dg keys --list
dg keys --create --comment 'ci-pipeline' --scopes member --dry-run
dg usage --last-month
dg requests --status failed --endpoint listen --limit 20

# Anything the flags do not cover.
dg api '/v1/listen?model=nova-3&keyterm=spacewalk' -X POST -f url=https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav
dg api /v1/projects                                  # two JSON documents on stdout, see below
dg api /v1/projects --jq '.projects[0].project_id'   # shells out to a local jq
```

`dg -o json listen` returns the Deepgram response verbatim, with the same `metadata` and `results.channels[].alternatives[]` shape as `POST /v1/listen`. Script against that, not against the pretty output. On 0.3.1 a URL source first prints `Checking URL accessibility...` on stdout, so `dg -o json listen https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav | jq .` fails on that line while a local file parses cleanly; download the file first, or drop the first line with `tail -n +2`. On `main` the line is written to stderr, so the release after 0.3.1 keeps stdout to the JSON body.

`dg api` writes two JSON documents to stdout: the response body, pretty-printed, then a result envelope with `status`, `message`, `method`, `url`, `status_code`, `response_body`, and `elapsed_ms`. `-o json` changes nothing and `--raw` only compacts the body, so a single-document parser such as Python's `json.load` fails with `Extra data`, while `jq` reads both documents and runs the filter on each. `--jq '<filter>'` prints the filter result and then the envelope, and it needs a `jq` binary on `PATH`: without one it prints a `jq Required` panel reading `jq is not installed` and fails. A non-JSON body, such as plain text, is printed as text, and an HTTP error status still prints the body and sets `"status": "error"` in the envelope.

## `dg skills`

`dg skills status` lists eight assistants it can detect: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, Aider, OpenCode, Cursor, and Cline. `dg skills install --all` and `dg skills setup` write files for the detected ones; `dg skills list`, `update`, and `remove` manage them. State lives in `~/.deepctl/skills/skills.json`.

It is not a substitute for `npx skills add deepgram/skills`. On 0.3.1:

- It downloads four hardcoded skills from this repository, `api`, `docs`, `setup-mcp`, and `starters`, from `raw.githubusercontent.com/deepgram/skills/main`. Every other skill in the repository, including the capability on-ramps, is never fetched, and the list does not grow when the repository adds one.
- For Claude Code it writes them to `~/.claude/commands/deepgram/*.md`, the slash-command directory at user scope, not `~/.claude/skills/`, and keeps the `name:` and `description:` skill frontmatter, which is not the slash-command schema.
- For Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode it concatenates the same four files into one blob at `~/.codex/instructions.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, or `~/.opencode/agents.md`, between `<!-- BEGIN deepctl CLI Reference (auto-generated by deepctl) -->` and `<!-- END deepctl CLI Reference -->` markers. Cursor gets the same blob as `~/.cursor/rules/deepctl.mdc`, overwritten whole with no markers. The blob holds no CLI command reference despite the marker text.

Use `npx skills add deepgram/skills` to get the full, current skill set. Use `dg skills` to check what a machine already has, or to seed a tool this repository's installer does not support.

## `dg init`

`dg init` clones from the templates gallery at `https://templates.dx.deepgram.com/api/templates`, which holds 44 templates in six categories: `transcription` (10), `live-transcription` (8), `text-to-speech` (7), `live-text-to-speech` (7), `voice-agent` (7), and `text-intelligence` (5). The command is alpha.

```bash
dg init --list                       # table plus JSON on one stdout, see below
dg init --list --search fastapi
dg init node-transcription --dir ./my-app --no-install --no-start
```

`-o json` does not clean up `dg init --list`: on 0.3.1 it prints the Rich table, a `<n> template(s)` count line, and then the JSON array of templates on one stdout, so the whole output does not parse. Take the array from the first line that starts with `[`.

It does more than `git clone`: it leaves `.git` intact so you can add your own remote, and it writes your key into the clone's `.env` as `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=`. That is a live secret on disk, so check `.gitignore` before committing. It also refuses to run until `git`, `node`, `npm`, `make`, and `curl` are all present, even with `--no-install`. The human output is a `Missing required tools:` checklist that marks each absent tool with `✗` and a download link; under `-o json` the error message reads `Missing tools: git, node, npm, make, curl`.

Three gallery caveats: the gallery carries no `flux` or `flux-tts` templates, so `dg init --list --search flux` returns `No templates found`; the `nextjs-*` entries live under the `deepgram-devs` org while every other template is under `deepgram-starters`; and `sinatra-transcription` points at an archived, private repository, so its URL returns 404.

## `dg mcp`

`dg mcp` runs a stdio MCP proxy, with `--transport sse --port 8000` for SSE. On 0.3.1 its `initialize` response names the server `deepgram-mcp` 0.1.10, while the latest `deepgram-mcp` package on PyPI is 0.1.1 and the command package installed with it is `deepctl-cmd-mcp` 0.1.15, so that number is not a package version to upgrade against. It exposes exactly one tool, `search_deepgram_knowledge_sources`, a semantic search over Deepgram's documentation. It exposes no transcription, synthesis, or project tools, so call `dg` directly for those. Use the `setup-mcp` skill for editor wiring.

## Regional and custom hosts

The global `--base-url` flag and the `DEEPGRAM_BASE_URL` env var both retarget the host, and REST and WebSocket endpoints are derived from whichever you set. `dg whoami` echoes the value back. Use them for self-hosted and staging deployments.

The regional hosts do not work on 0.3.1. Every command first checks credentials against `{base_url}/v1/projects`, and the management API is not served regionally, so `dg --base-url https://api.eu.deepgram.com listen file.wav` fails with `Error: Unexpected error: HTTP 404` while the same transcription request succeeds with curl against `api.eu.deepgram.com/v1/listen`. Use curl or an SDK for `api.eu.deepgram.com`, `api.au.deepgram.com`, and `api.in.deepgram.com`.

## Common mistakes

1. Trusting the exit code. 0.3.0 enforces exit codes, where earlier versions always exited 0: now 0 is success, 1 is an error or bad usage, and 2 is an interrupt. The contract has holes. `dg listen --mic` and `dg mcp` swallow Ctrl-C and exit 0, and `dg listen -` on Ctrl-C exits 134 after `Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy: could not acquire lock for <_io.BufferedReader name='<stdin>'> at interpreter shutdown`. API errors, missing files, and a missing API key do exit 1. In CI, check `"status"` in `-o json` as well as `$?`.
2. Expecting caption files from `--srt` or `--webvtt`. The docs label them "SRT subtitles" and "WebVTT captions", but on 0.3.1 `dg listen file.wav --srt --save-to out.srt` writes the plain transcript with no cue numbers and no timestamps, for a local file or a URL, under `-o table` or `-o json`. Use `dg -o json listen` and build cues from the word timestamps, or call the API.
3. Running `dg config set …`. Every help screen ends with `Disable: dg config set telemetry.enabled false`, but there is no `config` command, and the attempt returns `Error: No such command 'config'`. Set `DEEPCTL_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` instead, after which the footer reads `Telemetry is off.`
4. Putting a global flag after the subcommand. `dg listen --base-url <url> file.wav` returns `Error: No such option '--base-url'` plus a hint that it is a global option. Write `dg --base-url <url> listen file.wav`. The same holds for `--api-key`, `-p`, `-c`, and `--timing`; `-o`, `-q`, and `-v` work in either position, except on `dg speak`, where `-o` after the subcommand is the output file.
5. Treating `dg models` as the model catalog. It returns 553 rows, 942 with `--include-outdated`. Each row's `name` is the bare voice, `asteria`, and `canonical_name` carries the full identifier, `aura-2-asteria-en`, so script against `canonical_name`. Rows carry a `deprecated` flag, and the list holds no Flux STT or Flux TTS models at all. Take model names from the `speech-to-text` and `text-to-speech` skills.
6. Pointing Flux STT at a file. `dg listen file.wav -m flux-general-en` returns `Flux STT (flux-general-en) is streaming-only and cannot transcribe a file or URL.` Pipe stdin or use `--mic`, since Flux STT has no prerecorded mode.
7. Acting on `Warning: API key format doesn't match expected pattern`. A valid 40-character key triggers it and then verifies fine.
8. Expecting `dg login --profile <name>` to keep the key out of `config.yaml` without a keyring. On 0.3.1 with no keyring backend, `dg login --api-key "$KEY" --profile staging -f` writes the `staging` profile to `config.yaml` in cleartext, sets `active_profile: staging`, and writes the same key into the `default` profile as well; `dg profiles --list` shows both with the same masked key. The whole file is the secret, not one profile in it.

## Use a different skill when

- You want the MCP server wired into an editor: `setup-mcp` skill.
- You want a runnable starter app, the full starter matrix, or anything on Flux STT or Flux TTS: `starters` skill.
- You need a parameter, response schema, or WebSocket message the CLI does not expose: `api` skill.
- You are choosing a model or an endpoint: `speech-to-text`, `text-to-speech`, or `voice-agent` skill.
- You want application code rather than a shell command: the per-language SDK skills, installed with `npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk` and its siblings.
- You want a one-feature snippet: `recipes` skill. For a platform integration: `examples` skill.
